# OCR Confusion Table — Pure ASCII Visual Confusables
# Format: CONFUSABLE<TAB>CANONICAL
# Direction: Column 1 is what the attacker substitutes (the confusable),
#            Column 2 is the legitimate character it mimics.
# ocr_normalize() replaces column 1 → column 2, then compares against known domains.
# All canonical values (column 2) MUST be lowercase — comparison pipeline lowercases input.
# Confusable values with uppercase letters are dead (input is lowercased before matching).
# Multi-char sequences come first (longer match wins during normalization).
# Lines starting with # are comments. Empty lines ignored.

# Multi-char confusions (longer match wins)
